# Code Narratives
- Two-Week Session, Monday July 10th - Saturday July 22nd
- @ SFPC, 155 Bank street, West Village, NYC
- 7pm - 9:30pm, Evening Classes

SFPC's Summer Intensive: Code Narratives will explore the practice of generative writing using [Python](https://www.python.org/). We will start by collecting source texts as the fuel for our generators, and learn how to parse them for the parts we want most using language processing techniques. Once we have our source material, we will experiment with our writing machines in a variety of narrative forms like screenplays, twitter bots, and multimedia works. Students will create several small generative text projects over the course of the session and finish with a prototype of something larger, with opportunities to show work to the larger SFPC community toward the end. No coding experience required, all levels welcome.

## What will happen in these two weeks?
Classes are held in the evenings Monday-Friday from 7-9:30pm and the session will culminate in a party on the afternoon of Saturday July 22nd,  where students can invite their friends and present their favorite generative projects.

Students will have full access to the space for the two weeks of the session to work on projects between classes and mentors wil be readily available for technical, conceptual, and artistic guidance. Read our [Participate page](http://sfpc.io/participate/) for more information.
